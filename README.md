The project is written in C# within the Microsoft Visual Studio .NET Framework development environment. Its purpose is to simulate an online store, catering to both entrepreneurs and customers.
The composition of this project is created through a menu containing the following functionalities:
  - Saving and restoring data using TXT, binary, and XML files
  - Printing sales and customer lists
  - Creating an account for customers/entrepreneurs
  - Logging in for customers/entrepreneurs

All data is stored in SQLite databases (stores, sections, products, customers, and sales). The main interface consists of:
  - Adding a store
  - Adding a section
  - Adding a product
  - Adding a customer
  - Viewing customers and the entered store, along with a copy function
  - Purchasing products by adding to the cart + viewing the cart
  - Choosing a payment method and completing the transaction.
