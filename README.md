The project is written in C# in the Microsoft Visual Studio .NET Framework development environment.
It aims to simulate an online store, both for the entrepreneur and for the customer.
The composition of this project is created with the help of a menu in which the following functions:
  - saving and restoring data from TXT, binary and XML files
  - printing sales and customer list
  - account creation for the client/entrepreneur and login for the client/entrepreneur
  - graph generation for sale and data binding of data
All data are stored in SQLite databases (stores, districts, products, customers and sales).
The main interface consists of:
   - store addition
   - addition of rayon
   - product addition
   - add customer
   - viewing the customers and the entered store as well as the copy function
   - purchasing products by adding to the basket + viewing the basket
   - choosing the payment method and making the transaction.
To view the project and the interface, you can open the SLN and press Run.
